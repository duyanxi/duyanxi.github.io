**Actively looking for collaborators in Embodied AI.**

I am currently an MPhil student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the supervision of <a href='https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn'> Assistant Prof. Xiaoguang Han (韩晓光) </a>. I graduated from the School of Automation, Southeast University with a bachelor's degree majoring in robotics, supervised by <a href='https://www.yangangwang.com'> Prof. Yangang Wang (王雁刚) </a>. I was an exchange student at <a href='http://cvl.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/'> Computer Vision Lab </a> at Osaka University (大阪大学) under the supervision of Prof. Yasuyuki Matsushita (松下康之) and Associate Prof. Fumio Okura (大倉史生) during Sep 2024 to Feb 2025.

Currently, my research interests are 

- 3D/4D Human Body Pose Estimation and Recovery.

- 3D Generation and Feed-forward 3D Reconstruction.

- Embodied AI and Robotics.
