🔬 Research Experience
Towards Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (Osaka University FrontierLab Program)
Oct 2024 - Feb 2025

Independently established the project environment, implementing and replicating the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) baseline model using PyTorch.

Proposed and implemented a novel depth regularization method and a feed-forward model to address model instability under sparse-view inputs.

Multi-stage Image Story Generation (SEU International Summer School)
Aug 2024

Led a team to develop an image-to-story generation pipeline, achieving initial functionality through advanced prompt engineering and fine-tuning of the Google Gemini model.

Deployed and benchmarked multiple large language models locally, conducting extensive experiments on prompt design to enhance narrative coherence and creativity.

Large-scale 3D Human Body Reconstruction (Student Research Training Program)
Oct 2022 - Nov 2023

Implemented a baseline model based on OpenPose and YOLOX and conducted preliminary experiments and evaluations.

Assisted with building pseudo ground-truth on crowd datasets to promote research on pose estimation and human behavior understanding in large-scale crowded scenes.

Indoor Scene 3D Reconstruction with Multi-camera System (Bachelor Thesis)
Dec 2024 - May 2025

My undergraduate thesis project, recognized as an Excellent Thesis.

🎖 Honors and Awards
Jun 2025: Excellent Bachelor's Thesis (Top 15%), School of Automation, SEU

Jun 2025: SEU Undergraduates Scholarship in Social Work

May 2023: Outstanding Individual in Social Practice, SEU
