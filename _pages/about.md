**Looking for RA/Intern positions during 2025.9~2026.3**

I graduated from School of Automation, Southeast University (东南大学自动化学院) with a bachelor's degree, supervised by <a href='https://www.yangangwang.com'> Associate Prof. Yangang Wang (王雁刚) </a>.

I was working as an exchange student at <a href='http://cvl.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/'> Computer Vision Lab </a> at Osaka University (大阪大学) under the supervision of Prof. Matsushita Yasuyuki (松下康之) and Associate Prof. Fumio Okura (大倉史生) during 2024.9 to 2025.2.

Currently, my research interests are 

- Optimization and application of 3D Gaussian Splatting.

- 3D/4D Human Body Pose Estimation and Recovery.

- Large-scale 3D Surface Reconstruction. 

# 🔥 News
