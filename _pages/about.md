**Actively seeking Research Assistant / Intern positions for Fall 2025 - Summer 2026.**

I graduated from School of Automation, Southeast University (东南大学自动化学院) with a bachelor's degree, supervised by <a href='https://www.yangangwang.com'> Associate Prof. Yangang Wang (王雁刚) </a>. I was an exchange student at <a href='http://cvl.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/'> Computer Vision Lab </a> at Osaka University (大阪大学) under the supervision of Prof. Matsushita Yasuyuki (松下康之) and Associate Prof. Fumio Okura (大倉史生) during Sep 2024 to Feb 2025.

Currently, my research interests are 

- 3D/4D Human Body Pose Estimation and Recovery.

- Multi-view Geometry and 3D Reconstruction.

- Optimization and Application of 3D Gaussian Splatting.
